# Agnitra Documentation

Agnitra delivers an end-to-end optimization platform that pairs model tuning, telemetry, and usage-based billing in a single developer flow. Use the SDK or CLI to profile workloads, generate optimized TorchScript artifacts, and push structured usage records into your control plane or marketplace integrations.

## What You’ll Find

- **Guides** that help you install the SDK, run the CLI, and wire the Agentic Optimization API into your pipeline.
- **Operational runbooks** describing telemetry, monetization, and publishing workflows.
- **Reference material** for marketplace adapters and the internal Responses API contract (`internal-docs/responses_api.mdx`).

If you are new to Agnitra, start with [Getting Started](./getting-started.mdx) for a high-level tour and installation steps. When you are ready to automate packaging or deployments, jump to [Publishing Packages](./publishing.md).

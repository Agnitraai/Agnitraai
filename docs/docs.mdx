# Welcome to Agnitra

Agnitra is the optimization control plane for large language models. It compiles TorchScript and ONNX graphs, benchmarks GPU kernels with reinforcement learning, captures telemetry, and emits marketplace-ready usage events so finance, ops, and product teams stay in sync.

## Why teams choose Agnitra

- **Optimization automation** – Ship tuned artifacts for A100, A10G, and CPU targets without manual kernel surgery.
- **End-to-end telemetry** – Collect latency, throughput, and GPU utilization data that feeds dashboards or billing exports.
- **Usage-based monetization** – Generate structured events compatible with Stripe, AWS Marketplace, and internal ledgers.
- **Enterprise-ready operations** – Offline execution, license enforcement, and auditable metadata baked into every run.

## Pick your workflow

- [Quickstart](./quickstart) – Complete setup, run your first optimization, and inspect telemetry in under 15 minutes.
- [Python SDK](./python-sdk) – Embed Agnitra in notebooks, services, or agents with rich telemetry routing.
- [JavaScript SDK](./javascript-sdk) – Add optimization and usage reporting to Node.js or browser-based apps.
- [CLI Automation](./cli) – Power CI/CD pipelines and one-off investigations from any shell.
- [Telemetry & Billing](./telemetry) – Wire Agnitra outputs into dashboards, data warehouses, and marketplaces.
- [Operations](./operations) – Deploy the control plane, secure access, and scale observability in production.

## Platform capabilities

| Capability | What it delivers | Where to learn |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Model optimization | Reinforcement-learning tuned kernels with deterministic fallbacks. | [Quickstart](./quickstart), [CLI](./cli) |
| Telemetry capture | JSON bundles summarizing speedup, GPU hours saved, and bottleneck traces. | [Telemetry & Billing](./telemetry) |
| Usage metering | Contract-grade usage events for per-call billing or licensing. | [Telemetry & Billing](./telemetry) |
| Deployment controls | Offline execution, license seats, and multi-environment secrets management. | [Operations](./operations) |

## Next steps

1. Start with the [Quickstart](./quickstart) to validate the workflow locally.
2. Integrate optimizations into your preferred runtime using the [Python](./python-sdk) or [JavaScript](./javascript-sdk) guides.
3. Automate builds and telemetry exports via the [CLI](./cli) and [Telemetry](./telemetry) playbooks.
4. Roll out to production following the [Operations](./operations) checklist and keep finance teams informed with real-time usage data.

# Quickstart

Welcome aboard! This guide walks you through installing the Agnitra SDKs, running your first optimization, and validating the telemetry and usage outputs that power production workflows.

> **Estimated time:** 15 minutes  
> **Prerequisites:** Python 3.8+, PyTorch 2.0+, optional CUDA/cuDNN when targeting GPUs.

## 1. Prepare your environment

1. Create and activate a virtual environment.
2. Install the Agnitra package with extras that match your workflow:

```bash
pip install agnitra[nvml,marketplace]
# or for local development
pip install -e .[openai,rl,nvml,marketplace]
```

3. Export the control-plane credentials:

```bash
export AGNITRA_API_KEY="sk-live-..."
export AGNITRA_API_BASE_URL="https://api.agnitra.ai"  # use your staging URL when self-hosting
```

## 2. Optimize a model from the CLI

```bash
agnitra optimize \
  --model tinyllama.pt \
  --input-shape 1,16,64 \
  --target A100 \
  --output dist/tinyllama_optimized.pt \
  --telemetry-out telemetry.json
```

The run prints kernel-level hotspots, expected speedup, and a usage summary (GPU hours saved, estimated cost). The optimized artifact lands in `dist/` and telemetry is captured in `telemetry.json`.

### Verify the outputs

- **Artifact:** Load `dist/tinyllama_optimized.pt` in a Python shell and confirm inference works on representative inputs.
- **Telemetry:** Inspect `telemetry.json` to confirm it includes latency metrics, GPU utilization, and usage metadata.
- **Usage event:** Forward the summary to your billing pipeline using `agnitra.telemetry.usage_meter` or export it manually with `jq`.

## 3. Mirror the workflow in Python

```python
import torch
from agnitra import optimize

model = torch.jit.load("tinyllama.pt")
sample = torch.randn(1, 16, 64)

result = optimize(
    model,
    input_tensor=sample,
    project_id="demo",
    metadata={"source": "quickstart"}
)

print(f"Optimized speedup: {result.bottleneck.expected_speedup_pct}%")
result.telemetry.write_json("telemetry.json")
```

The `RuntimeOptimizationResult` bundles the optimized model, telemetry, and usage event so you can persist or forward them downstream.

## 4. Review telemetry in the dashboard

```bash
agnitra-dashboard --telemetry telemetry.json --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3000
```

Open the printed URL to explore bottleneck heatmaps, GPU hour savings, and license seat utilization. This mirrors the managed dashboard experience for quick audits.

## 5. Next steps

| Goal | Where to go next |
| --- | --- |
| Automate more complex jobs | [CLI Automation](./cli) |
| Embed in notebooks and services | [Python SDK](./python-sdk) |
| Integrate with Node.js or browser runtimes | [JavaScript SDK](./javascript-sdk) |
| Push telemetry and usage events to downstream systems | [Telemetry & Billing](./telemetry) |
| Productionizing the control plane | [Operations](./operations) |
